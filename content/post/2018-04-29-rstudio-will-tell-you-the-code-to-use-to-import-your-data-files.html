<p>When it comes to importing data files, such as csv’s or xls’s, it can be uncertain which method to use. It can also be easy to forget how to do it, or the options that are at hand.</p>
<p>Thankfully, RStudio will suggest code to use to import the files. In the lower right quadrant, the area tabbed with “Files,” “Plots,” “Packages,” “Help,” and “Viewer,” make sure you’re on the “Files” tab and navigate to the folder where your data file is stored. Single click on the file and a little window will pop up. Select “Import dataset.”</p>

<p>Then a new, larger window will appear that provides a preview of the data itself as well as import options. If the data looks weird or is empty, make sure the import options are correct. For example, make sure the delimiter option is set to comma, tab, semi-colon or whatever the separator is in your file.</p>
<p>Once everything is ready to go, it’s time to finish importing the dataset, including grabbing the code to use in your file or project. You can find the code preview in the lower right corner of this same window. Copy that and then click import below that window.</p>

<p>Now just paste your code in your file or project and you’re set to proceed.</p>
